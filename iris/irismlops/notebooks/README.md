# Notebooks Folder

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks used for various stages of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.

## Notebooks

- **data_exploration.ipynb**: Used to explore the raw data, generate visualizations, and perform initial analysis.
- **data_preprocessing.ipynb**: Prepares raw data for model training, including cleaning, encoding, and feature engineering.
- **model_training.ipynb**: Trains machine learning models on processed data, evaluates performance, and generates reports.

## Usage

- Open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab or Notebook by running:

  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- Ensure that the corresponding datasets (raw or processed) are available in the data/ folder before running the notebooks.
