## Models

| Model Name   | Training Data | Description  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Model 1      | Processed Dataset 1 | Description of the model architecture, performance metrics, etc. |
| Model 2      | Processed Dataset 2 | Description of the model, the input/output format, etc. |

### Usage

Models can be loaded using the following scripts:
- `src/model.py` for loading and inference.
- `notebooks/model_training.ipynb` for further model training or evaluation.

For detailed information on how the models were trained and their evaluation, refer to the individual model training notebook or report.
