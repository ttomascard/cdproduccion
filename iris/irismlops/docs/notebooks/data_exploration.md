# Data Exploration Notebook

This notebook (`notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb`) provides an initial overview and analysis of the raw data.

## Objectives

- Load and inspect the raw datasets.
- Conduct basic data profiling to identify trends, missing values, and data distributions.
- Generate visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to explore relationships between variables.

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb
```

2. Ensure the raw datasets are located in the data/raw/ folder before running the notebook.

## Outputs

- Basic statistical summaries (mean, median, mode, etc.).
- Visualizations to understand correlations between features.
