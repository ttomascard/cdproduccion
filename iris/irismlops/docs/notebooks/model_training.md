# Model Training Notebook

This notebook (`notebooks/model_training.ipynb`) is used for training machine learning models.

## Objectives

- Load processed data and split into training and testing sets.
- Train machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, neural networks).
- Evaluate models using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/model_training.ipynb
```

2. Ensure the processed data is available in data/processed/.

## Outputs

- Trained models are saved in the data/models/ folder.
- Performance metrics and evaluation reports are generated.
